# Forecasting for Favoritas grocery stores
 we aim to develop a sales forecasting model for a grocery store that leverages historical sales data, external factors such as weather, and other relevant variables. Our goal is to provide the grocery store with accurate predictions of future sales to help them make informed decisions about inventory management, staffing, and promotions.
